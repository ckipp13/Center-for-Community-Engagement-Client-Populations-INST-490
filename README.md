## 📘 Project Overview

The **CP Community Resource Hub** is a simplified, multilingual platform created to connect underserved communities in College Park, Maryland, with essential local resources.

Developed in collaboration with the **University of Maryland's Center for Community Engagement (CCE)**, the project focuses on:
- ✅ Accessibility
- ✅ Inclusivity
- ✅ Sustainability

In addition to designing the platform, our team conducted user research and developed personas to ensure the platform reflects the real needs of diverse community members. The goal is to improve resource navigation **without duplicating** efforts of existing platforms like **211 Maryland**.

## 🔄 Process

🧭 The original scope of this capstone project was to develop user personas representing the needs of underserved populations in College Park.

🤝 After an initial meeting with **Gloria Aparicio Blackwell**, Director of the Center for Community Engagement, we learned that many community members were unaware of or unable to access critical local services.

💡 In response, our team **pivoted** the project scope to include a resource navigation platform in addition to the personas. This would provide **immediate value to the community** while allowing the personas to inform both current and future initiatives.

📈 The final deliverables:
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **User Personas** — Built from real interviews and research
- 🌐 **Resource Hub Platform** — A live prototype connecting users to essential services like food, health, and transportation
