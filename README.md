# Center-of-Community-Engagement-Client-Populations-INST-490
Capstone Project

## Project Overview

The **CP Community Resource Hub** is a simplified, multilingual platform created to connect underserved communities in College Park, Maryland, with essential local resources. Developed in collaboration with the University of Maryland's Center for Community Engagement (CCE), the project focuses on accessibility, inclusivity, and sustainability. In addition to designing the platform, our team conducted user research and developed personas to ensure the platform reflects the real needs of diverse community members. The goal is to improve resource navigation without duplicating efforts of existing platforms like 211 Maryland.
